During the reign of the Elmoraden Empire, seven strong seals were crafted by Einhasad, the Goddess of Light, to contain the power of Shilen, the Goddess of Death.<br1>
Two groups, the Rulers of Dawn and the Revolutionaries of Dusk, are now struggling with each other over possession of these powerful seals. Players may join one or the other party and compete with each other to gain control over the power of seals.<br>
The Rulers of Dawn consists of castle-holding clans or alliances; the opposing Revolutionaries of Dusk consists of everyone else. As such, the struggle for the Seven Signs is ultimately a battle between castle-owners and non-castle owners.<br>

<font color="LEVEL">[ Selection of Seal ]</font><br>
You must decide which seal you wish to fight for.<br>
To control a seal, more than 35% of the members of the party must fight for that seal. If a party controlled a seal in the previous competition and if 10% or more of their members continue to fight for that seal, they'll control it again.<br>

Come one, come all! Welcome to the monster arena, the greatest venue for thrills and combat!<br>
Recently, the arena owner contracted with the Ivory Tower, giving you the ability to come to the monster arena from any big city through a gatekeeper! Security is also our top priority, so in order to protect customer's funds we blocked the path to the outside and strengthened all censorship.<br>
So now, go inside and enjoy the new monster arena! Give yourself a vacation!<br>

<html><body>Gatekeeper Tatiana:<br>
Nice to meet you. I am Tatiana, Gatekeeper of the Town of Goddard. The Gate, which is the door of space and time, enables you to traverse long distances in a flash. But in order to learn how to use it, you must train for a long time in the Ivory Tower, just like I did.<br>
Now! Have you decided where to travel?<br>
